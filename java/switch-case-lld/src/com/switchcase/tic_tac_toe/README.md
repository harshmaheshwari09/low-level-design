# Problem Statement: Tic Tac Toe Low-Level Design

Design a low-level system for playing the game of Tic Tac Toe. The system should allow two players to compete against
each other on a 3x3 grid, taking turns to place their respective markers (X or O) in empty cells. The objective of the
game is for a player to form a straight line of their markers horizontally, vertically, or diagonally before the
opponent does.

The low-level design should include the following features and considerations:

1. **Game Initialization**: The system should provide a way to initialize a new game of Tic Tac Toe, setting up the game board
with an empty grid.

2. **Player Turns**: The system should facilitate the alternating turns between the two players, allowing them to choose an
empty cell to place their marker.

3. **Validity Checks**: The system should validate each player's move to ensure they select an unoccupied cell on the grid. If
an invalid move is attempted, the system should prompt the player to select a different cell.

4. **Win Condition**: The system should detect when a player has formed a line of their markers horizontally, vertically, or
diagonally. Upon detecting a win, the system should declare the winning player.

5. **Tie Condition**: The system should detect when all cells on the grid have been filled and no player has achieved a win. In
this case, the system should declare a tie game.

6. **User Interface**: The low-level design should consider how the game interface will be presented to the players. This can
include options such as a command-line interface or a graphical user interface (GUI).

7. **Extensibility**: The design should be flexible enough to accommodate potential future enhancements, such as allowing for
different grid sizes.

Overall, the goal is to create an efficient and user-friendly low-level design for the game of Tic Tac Toe that provides
a seamless experience for players, handles various game states, and allows for potential expansions in the future.
