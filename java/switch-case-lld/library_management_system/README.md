# Library Management System

This is the README file for the Low-Level Design of a Library Management System.

## Introduction

The Library Management System is designed to efficiently manage the operations and activities in a library. It provides
features such as user authentication, book search, book issuing, book return, fine calculation for late returns, book
management by the librarian, user management, and display operations.

## Features

1. **Authentication**: The system includes an authentication feature to ensure secure access. Users need to authenticate
   themselves with valid credentials before accessing the system.
2. **Book Search**: Users can search for books based on the author or title. This allows users to find specific books
   easily and efficiently.
3. **Book Issuing, Return, and Reissue**: The system enables users to issue books from the library, return books, and
   reissue books if they need to extend the loan period.
4. **Fine Calculation**: The system automatically calculates fines for late book returns. It tracks the return date and
   calculates the fine based on the predefined rules or policies of the library.
5. **Book Management**: The librarian has the authority to add or remove books from the library. This feature ensures
   that the library's collection is always up to date.
6. **User Management**: The librarian can block or unblock users based on specific requirements or circumstances. This
   feature helps in managing user accounts effectively.
7. **Display Operations**: The system supports display operations for users, books, and reference tickets. Users can
   view their account details, book availability, and any reference tickets they have issued.
